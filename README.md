# DeelAssessment
Hi there,
This is an assessment that I did from Deel hiring process. The thing is that I am supposed to automate some stuffs for their web application.

Pre condition:
You have to install webdriveio, Mocha as a test runner and Allure as a reporter (https://webdriver.io, https://mochajs.org, https://docs.qameta.io/allure/).
Go to your terminal and install all these tools with :
npm init wdio "nameofyourproject"
You can execute your project with :
npm run wdio
